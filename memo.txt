- Because psp34::Id doesn't implement Default trait, it cannot be used as a field of structs.
  For now, using openbrush-contracts forked branch and implement Default trait by myself.

- Access Control, following Open brush access control specification. Admin can manage roles,
  multiple accounts can have a same role.

- Right now, ink! can allow event definition in root contract file only `#[ink(event)]`.
  Once this limitation eliminated, there's no need to have emit_event function for each Internal trait.
